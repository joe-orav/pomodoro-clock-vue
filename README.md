# Pomodoro Clock
A Pomodoro Clock app that allows you to set your session and break length and even includes some nice visuals while in use. This is my second Pomodoro Clock app which was developed with Vue. [Here](https://github.com/joe-orav/pomodoro-clock) is my first one developed with React.

## Accessing the App
